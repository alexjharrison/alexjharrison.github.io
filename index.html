<!-- <p>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer based out of the greater New York metropolitan area.  For the past six years, I have been working at Ivoclar Vivadent, the worlds leading supplier of dental ceramics and equipment.  I was working as a quality control technician for that time, testing the material characteristics that go into making false teeth.  While there I used C# and VBA to create programs to automate many of the processes in the production and QC testing.  Many of these programs were used to allow different production machines to speak to one another, reducing the need for user input from the operator.  This reduced human error and massively increased the output that the production line was able to manufacture.  Since the company was unable to place me in a permanent more technical role, I joined the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am increasing my skills in web development.</p>
            <p>My main focus moving forward is to build really cool things.  I have mastered the art of google search so if there is a gap in my knowledge, I know exactly how to rectify it.  The dream job would be one where I can learn new skills while building projects that will impress anyone with or without technical knowledge.</p> -->
