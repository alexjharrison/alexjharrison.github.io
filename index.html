            <p>Hi there!  My name’s Alex Harrison and I am set out to become a full stack web developer.  Ever since I was a wee lad, I’ve been hacking away at computers.  In the early days I slayed the DOS commands on my grandmother’s Apple IIe and read files from those five inch floppy drives.  Everybody remembers the 3” disks taking the A:/ drive but who remembers the 5” B:/ drive?  👉This guy 👈</p>
            <p>I’ve had experience in programming in such languages as Java, C++ , regular ‘ol C, Assembler for an 8086 processor, VB functions for Excel, and most recently C#.  I know enough of these languages to say hello to the world and do some basic calculation functions but not near enough to get paid to do stuff.  Also, I am insane and have played through many programming style games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/" target="_blank">SpaceChem</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/" target="_blank">TIS-100</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/" target="_blank">Shenzhen IO</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510/Uplink/" target="_blank">Uplink</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet/" target="_blank">HackNet</a>. <a href="assets/images/spacechem.png" target="_blank">Proof of insanity</a></p>
